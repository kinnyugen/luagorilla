# LuaMonke
LuaMonke is a Lua library for developing Gorilla Tag mods. It works to provide mostly accurate mod development to the equivalent of what you would get in Unity C#. It is both a Gorilla Tag mod written in C#, a Lua interpreter, and a library.

## Installation
Drag ``Lua.dll`` into your ``/BepInEx/plugins`` folder and restart. Place Lua code into the ``/BepInEx/plugins/Lua/`` directory.
